    Under the guidance of the Blessed Holy Spirit, the Mission of the Church of God in Jamaica is to win souls for the Kingdom of God through holistic interactions consistent with the mandate of the Great commission GIVEN TO THE Church by our Lord Jesus Christ, in St Mathew 28: 19-20.
    <p>
    Fulfillment of this Mission shall embrace a cultural, as well as an evangelistic, approach to administration of the Word, doctrine, worship and counseling; and the application of wisdom in the use of the resources at the Churchâ€™s disposal.
